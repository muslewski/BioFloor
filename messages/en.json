      "BrownCardDescription2": "Biofloor effectively absorbs moisture, keeping the coop in optimal conditions. Its ability to retain moisture prevents wet spots that promote bacteria and mold growth.

      "BrownCardDescription4": "With Biofloor, cleaning the coop becomes quick and convenient - just replace the soiled layer with a fresh one. Straw and straw pellets often clump and are difficult to remove, while peat is light but dusty. BioFloor makes it easier to maintain hygiene, reducing the time and effort needed for daily care.",
      "BrownCardTitle5": "Natural protection against bacteria and fungi",
      "BrownCardDescription5": "Biofloor acts as a natural protective barrier, limiting the growth of bacteria and fungi. Regularly tested for Salmonella and fungal spores, it is a safer alternative to peat, which can be a source of pathogens, and straw, which often contains chemical residues.",
